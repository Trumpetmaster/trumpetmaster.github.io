Afterwards,\n             Mikey introduced me to  John Fraboni, the CEO and founder of Operation Spark, for the \n             prototype boot camp.

Spark has also partisipated \n                in a hack-o-thon at Essence Fest in New Orleans,Lousiana. Fast forwarding to a more recent events,\n            Spark had a Show case in which the participants made more advanced apps with \n            algoritms they explained to their test subjects while they played their game. \n            \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Our next show case will unfortunately be our final show case of the semester.
