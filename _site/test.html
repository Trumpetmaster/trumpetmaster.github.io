                    Hello World, My name is Shane C. Anderson and I am an official alumni for
                Operation Spark.I am 17 years and a Junior at International High School 
                of New Orleans and a level One at NOCCA(New Orleans Center for Creative Arts) 
                in the Classical Department. 
            </p>
            <p>
                  I have been involved in Operation Spark since the very beginning of time. I was first 
              introduced to the boot camp for Spark by Mikey Muhanna,from Positive Space. Afterwards,
             Mikey introduced me to  John Fraboni, the CEO and founder of Operation Spark, for the 
             prototype boot camp. It was a five week bootcamp that focused on the foundations of coding.
             
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, there were multiple show cases in which Spark participants made simple 
                command-line apps using the programming language java-script. Spark has also partisipated 
                in a hack-o-thon at Essence Fest in New Orleans,Lousiana. Fast forwarding to a more recent events,
            Spark had a Show case in which the participants made more advanced apps with 
            algoritms they explained to their test subjects while they played their game. 
            
            </p>
            <p>
            Our next show case will unfortunately be our final show case of the semester. My time with 
            Operation Spark has been one of the best experiences of my life and I cannot thank John,
            Mikey, Sam Batten, Goerge Maur,and Steve Price enough for teaching me the way of coding and 
            me another passion. 
            </p>
