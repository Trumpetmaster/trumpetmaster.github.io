Hello World, My name is Shane C. Anderson and I am an official alumni for Operation Spark.I am 17 years and a Junior at International High School of New Orleans and a level One at NOCCA(New Orleans Center for Creative Arts) in the Classical Department.

I have been involved in Operation Spark since the very beginning of time. I was first introduced to the boot camp for Spark by Mikey Muhanna,from Positive Space. Afterwards,Mikey introduced me to  John Fraboni, the CEO and founder of Operation Spark, for the 
prototype boot camp. It was a five week bootcamp that focused on the foundations of coding.
             
            
command-line apps using the programming language java-script. Spark has also partisipated 
In addition, there were multiple show cases in which Spark participants made simple 
            
in a hack-o-thon at Essence Fest in New Orleans,Lousiana. Fast forwarding to a more recent events,
Spark had a Show case in which the participants made more advanced apps with 
algoritms they explained to their test subjects while they played their game. 
            
Our next show case will unfortunately be our final show case of the semester. My time with 
Mikey, Sam Batten, Goerge Maur,and Steve Price enough for teaching me the way of coding and 
me another passion.
